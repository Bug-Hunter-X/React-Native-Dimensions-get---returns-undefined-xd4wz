This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` unexpectedly, especially during the initial render or when there's a race condition between component mounting and the API's response.

```javascript
// Incorrect way
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
```

This will cause a runtime error if `Dimensions.get('window')` is `undefined`.
